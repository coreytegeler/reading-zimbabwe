Too many publications since 2000. Is 20 years too young to comprehend one’s history? More white historians, academics. Where are the the black Zimbabweans, especially when Mugabe has made so much noise about decolonization? Unlike his peers like Nelson Mandela, Julius Nyerere, Nkwame Nkurumah, Ndabaningi Sithole, Kenneth Kaunda, Mugabe has never written a book. When you talk about decolonisation, what do you talk about when its not anchored in ideology? This is proof of Mugabe as crafty, cunning and populist.
