Intro: How do we read a country? Who gets to tell a countryâ€™s stories? How do we come to understand a place and its people? What kind of books does the Zim&shy;babwe government select to educate its young people? It was these questions that provoked us.  The way that knowledge is acquired is not innocent or objective but the end result of a process that reflects certain interests. The democratic rhetoric of independent Zim&shy;babwe is meaningless because it has had no relationship to everyday reality. This virtual archive is devoted to trying to demystify ways of thinking that polarize and oppose.  Reading is freedom. Especially at a time in which the values of reading and inwardness are so strenuously challenged, reading is freedom.
