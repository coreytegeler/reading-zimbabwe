Synopsis: An intimate account of one family's bravery in the face of brutality, as well as perhaps the outside world's only real glimpse of what it is like to live inside the terror of Mugabe's Zimbabwe. The fight for justice in Zimbabwe is far from over; this book is for anyone who wants to see into the heart of one of today's hardest places, and how human dignity flourishes even in the most adverse circumstances.

Review: Freeth lays bare a beautiful but lawless land fouled by fear. A 'Clockwork Orange' state where racism, greed and violence are ultimately humbled by almost unimaginable courage. Richly described, bravely chronicled and utterly compelling.  â€”Mike Thompson, BBC Radio's Foreign Affairs Correspondent
