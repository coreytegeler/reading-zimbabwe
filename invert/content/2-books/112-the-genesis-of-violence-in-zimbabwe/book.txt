Synopsis: Zimbabwe,a country in Southern Africa has been a scene of several levels of violence since 1879.This violence has reached alarming levels that are unacceptable . The violence has tended to escalate as the country approaches elections. Zimbabwe will hold elections in March 2013 and it is hoped that they could be held peacefully.But in order for peaceful elections to be held there is need to understand and discover the possible causes of such violent tendencies that have left a trail of murder,mayhem and gaping emotional wounds. The objective of this book is to assist this process and try to find a way forward through instilling and affirming national reconciliation among all the people of Zimbabwe,regardless of ethnicity, color or creed.
