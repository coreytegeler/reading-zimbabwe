Synopsis: Zimbabwe's government is tired and discredited and the country is stretched to breaking point. What will come next? Should the society shift from rule by an exhausted nationalist clique, to a neo-liberal free-market economy, as advocated by the big-business wing of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change? This guide argues that Zimbabwe must confront the political-economic contradictions. It sketches an alternative political project drawing upon the Zimbabwean people's own struggles for social justice.
