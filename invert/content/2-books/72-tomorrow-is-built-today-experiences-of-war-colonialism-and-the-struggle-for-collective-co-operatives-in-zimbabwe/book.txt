Synopsis: This is the autobiography of a youth from rural Zimbabwe who become a worker, a trade union organizer, a student and then a guerrilla commander. As ZIPRA fighters, Andrew Nyathi and his comrades paint a vivid, authentic picture of the war in one important region of Zimbabwe. The story speaks honestly of the pain and frustration of guerrillas isolated for nearly two years in assembly points while politicians and British advisers decided their future and the future of the country they had liberated. It tells how a group of fighters from both liberation armies decided to 'go it alone' in the face of intense political and bureaucratic harassment to lay the foundations for a non-partisan collective co-operative movement in Zimbabwe. It is finally about the development of SImukai: a vibrant, successful collective farming co-operative proof that a new kind of democratic social and economic organization is possible in Africa despite innumerable obstacles. This is a story of struggle and survival. It is an extraordinary chronicle of courage, sacrifice, disappointment and finally, success. It is both lessons and inspiration for those who wish to see a new, productive and truly democratic Africa.
