Synopsis: Unable to recall when exactly he died, Robert Mugabe is shocked to be in the presence of God for trial. Facing him are countless people who died during his regime. They tell their stories, after which God condemns him to hell. Mugabe suddenly wakes up, in Harare, realizing he just had a dreadful dream. Set in the African Afterlife, The Trial of Robert Mugabe tells the Zimbabwean story from the perspectives of two iconic Zimbabwean writers, Yvonne Vera and Dambudzo Marechera, present at the trial. At the core of the trial is Gukurahundi (1982-1987), a highly orchestrated genocide on Ndebele people by Mugabe's North Korean trained Fifth Brigade

Review: This important book draws deep from the well of African literature to challenge a post-independence leadership whose discourse of victimhood has been used to legitimate the most appalling brutalities. Chielo Zona Eze makes Robert Mugabe answerable for the massacres of Gukurahundi in the 1980s and the tortures and rapes perpetrated by the Green Bombers in the 2000s. A skillfully-crafted novel and a deep philosophical analysis of postcolonial fever. --Prof. Meg Samuelson
