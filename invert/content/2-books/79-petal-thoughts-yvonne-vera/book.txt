Synopsis: This biography is largely based on Yvonne’s life and her novels. A young African post-colonial woman writer who had at the time of her death, captivated the hearts, souls, minds and intellect of the reading community throughout the world. The objective of this biography is to celebrate the life of a brilliant mind, an amazing woman. A woman whose pursuit to highlight the changes and struggles African women experience, is superb. She clearly portrays women’s encounters with religion, politics, love, colonialism, life, patriarchy and death with in-depth detail suggesting intimate understanding. The success of this biography should be its ability to contribute to the portrayal of women and their strengths and diverse identities in relation to their life encounters.
