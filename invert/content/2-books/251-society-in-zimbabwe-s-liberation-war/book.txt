Synopsis: This work examines people's beliefs, ideas and experiences both during Zimbabwe's liberation war and afterwards. The contributors look at African religion and Christianity and explore the efforts to educate people for a new society. They also look at the ideas used by whites to justify brutality and at the civilian experiences at the hands of the guerillas and the Fifth Brigade. Finally, they ask whether the new ideas were carried on after the war had ended.
