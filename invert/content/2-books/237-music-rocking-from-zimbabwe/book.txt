Synopsis: Music is a powerful expression and a very important part of life whether one is black or white. Just like the keys on the piano, one cannot produce melodic and beautiful music without playing both black and white keys. Zimbabwe is home to a wide variety of musical styles, influenced by musicians of many different backgrounds. It is with this in mind that Professor Fred Zindi has created this much-needed music guide which lays out the fundamentals of music appreciation and gives an introduction to Zimbabwe's vibrant musical culture.
