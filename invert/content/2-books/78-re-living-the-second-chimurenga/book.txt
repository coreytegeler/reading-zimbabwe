Synopsis: In her memoirs, Fay Chung presents her first-hand experience of the Zimbabwean liberation struggle and the reforms of the country's educational system, which followed. She gives her personal interpretation of Zimbabwe's trajectory over thirty years from a nationalist uprising, through the promises of the first independent government, to the turmoil of land invasions, new democratic challenges, and political violence. Chung 's memoirs--in many ways controversial--offer a valuable and thought-provoking introduction to modern Zimbabwean history and burning issues in the contemporary politics of Southern Africa.
