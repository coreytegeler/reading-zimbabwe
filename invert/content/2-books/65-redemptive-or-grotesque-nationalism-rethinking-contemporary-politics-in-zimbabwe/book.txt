Synopsis: At the beginning of 2000, with the launch of the so-called Third Chimurenga, Zimbabwean nationalism revealed some of its most grotesque aspects, resulting in a polarisation of the nation into ‘patriots’ and ‘sell-outs’ and dividing academics into groups such as ‘regime intellectuals’, left-nationalists, left-internationalists, ‘nativists’ and ‘neo-liberals’. Drawing upon the arguments and insights of an array of scholars, many based in Zimbabwe, this book offers a new analysis of the grotesque character of Zimbabwean nationalism, a nationalism that has provoked ambivalent responses locally, regionally and internationally.

Review: This collection casts a fresh eye on Zimbabwean nationalism past and present. This is important reading for anyone interested in understanding the perilous interplay of ‘dismantling and building’ that has shaped Zimbabwean nationalism’s many transformations. - Jocelyn Alexander, Professor of Commonwealth Studies, University of Oxford
