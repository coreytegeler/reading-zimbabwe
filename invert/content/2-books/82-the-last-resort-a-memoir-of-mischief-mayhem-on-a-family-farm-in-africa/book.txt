Synopsis: *The Last Resort *is a remarkable true story about one family in a country under siege and a testament to the love, perseverance, and resilience of the human spirit.  When Zimbabwe’s president Robert Mugabe launched his violent program to reclaim white-owned land and Rogers’s parents were caught in the cross fire, everything changed. Lyn and Ros, the owners of Drifters–a famous game farm and backpacker lodge in the eastern mountains that was one of the most popular budget resorts in the country–found their home and resort under siege, their friends and neighbors expelled, and their lives in danger. But instead of leaving, as their son pleads with them to do, they haul out a shotgun and decide to stay.

Review: This vibrant, tragic and surprisingly funny book is the best account yet of ordinary life—for blacks and whites—under Mugabe’s dictatorship. —The New York Times Book Review
