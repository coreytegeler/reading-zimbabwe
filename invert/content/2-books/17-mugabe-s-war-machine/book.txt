Synopsis: Mugabe’s dictatorship had survived due to the vicious military oppression of the population and the ruthless suppression of opposition. At the same time Mugabe has indulged in numerous military interventions outside his borders regardless of the cost in terms of regional stability, lives and money. The authors examine the background to Mugabe’s accession to power through the black nationalist insurgencies against white rule and the civil war between the black Zimbabweans (ZANLA, ZIPRA and militia groups.) Once Black power was established in 1980, Mugabe launched a brutal campaign in Matabeleland using his Central Intelligence Organization, police, army and the Special Forces 5th Brigade. At least 30,000 ‘insurgents’ and civilians were killed. From 1982 the Zimbabwe Defense Forces (ZDF) deployed to Mozambique to secure vital transport arteries to the coast. In 1985 ZDF fought alongside troops from Kenya and Tanzania against Renamo and the South African Defense Forces.
