Synopsis: It is argued in this volume that inequitable land distribution is the largest single issue threatening the Southern African Development Community (SADC) states' transition to democratic governance and its subsequent social, economic and political changes. The text examines problems with land rights and land claims in 21st-century SADC states. In particular, the legitimacy of counter-claims of title to real property, linked to conversion from oral governance before colonization to formal record governance after colonization, is analysed. The author examines the phenomenon of social change as an impetus for development of social conceptions of justice and, with it, substantive norms of law relating to ownership of real property.
