Synopsis: Proud, ruthless and erratic, Robert Mugabe is a unique figure. Almost alone among today's African presidents, Mugabe led the struggle against colonial rule and has dominated his country since independence. David Blair was forced to leave Zimbabwe in June 2001 as Mugabe sought to silence the media. Before then, he witnessed every twist and turn of the country's drama. This is the story from the hopeful era of new independence to the present reality of farm invasions, food riots, fuel queues and a terror campaign waged by Mugabe's supporters.

Aboutauthor: David Blair was Zimbabwe correspondent of the Daily Telegraph before being forced to leave by the Mugabe government in June 2001.
