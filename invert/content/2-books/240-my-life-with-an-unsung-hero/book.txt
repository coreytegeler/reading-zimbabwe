Synopsis: The purpose of the book is to educate the people about how Zimbabwe's armed struggle was started and who participated in the beginning. The author seeks to clarify some misrepresentations of events as they have been described. The book tries to show the foresighted thinking of Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole who was the founding president of ZANU the party Robert Mugabe now leads.
