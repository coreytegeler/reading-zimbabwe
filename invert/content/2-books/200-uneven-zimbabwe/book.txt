Synopsis: This book explains development, underdevelopment, economic crisis, structural adjustment, and class formation in one of the most unequal societies in the world. Intensified uneven development in Zimbabwe is mainly due to the periodic rise of financial capital, which has occurred, historically, in the 1890s, 1920s, 1950s, and the late 1980s - early 1990s with effects evident across urban and rural space and geographical scale.

Review: Uneven Zimbabwe examines the influence of domestic and international financial markets and financiers in uneven development in Zimbabwe, using, - and contributing to - the tools of radical political economy. Theoretically, Bond begins with criticism of classical Marxist concepts of "finance capital" for focusing on institutional characteristics and failing to grasp the underlying dynamics. Instead, as economic crisis tendencies emerge, the power of finance periodically intensifies, temporarily displacing crisis through time and space and across geographical scales. But the limits of the financial solution become evident when paper assets delink from the productive assets they are meant to represent, as well as in the role that finance plays in amplifying uneven development across different economic sectors, spaces and scales.
