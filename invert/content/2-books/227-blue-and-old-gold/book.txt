Synopsis: The BSAP held the honour of occupying the Right of the Line―one of the greatest police forces of the British Empire and Commonwealth. In 1889 Cecil John Rhodes was granted a royal charter by Queen Victoria to settle Mashonaland, in what was to become Southern Rhodesia. So was formed the British South Africa Company; its regiment of troopers raised to protect the occupying Pioneer Column dubbed the British South Africa Police, the BSAP. From the 1893 Matabele War, the 1896 Mashona Rebellion and the Jameson Raid, the Anglo–Boer War, through both world wars and finally to the bitter Rhodesian bush war of the 1960s and ’70s, troopers and officers of this fine regiment of policemen, both black and white, were proudly to the fore, in civilian and military roles … until the disbandment of the Force in 1980 when the country became the independent Zimbabwe.

Review: An old gold value indeed it is. *Blue and Old Gold - The History of the British South Africa Police (BSAP)* is a magnum opus without compare on the history of colonial police in Africa. Covering, in meticulous detail the 90 years of the force's existence, it is a connoisseur's dream and will be hard to emulate. Although the book has a scholarly approach, it is written in an entertaining easily accessible style. - Paul Naish
