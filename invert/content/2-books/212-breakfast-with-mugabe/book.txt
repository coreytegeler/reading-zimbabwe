Synopsis: A psychiatrist waits in State House, Harare, for his first encounter with a most unusual patient. Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, is in crisis, and Andrew Peric must discover the root of his anxiety. But can Mugabe be treated like any other patient?  Witty and provocative, Fraser Grace's new play imagines the combative relationship between the black president and his white psychiatrist. In a series of bruising encounters, *Breakfast with Mugabe* explores the conflict between despotism and liberalism in modern Zimbabwe.

Review: 'In Mr. Graceâ€™s capable hands, Mugabe rightfully deserves a seat alongside Macbeth, Richard III and other tragic, power-siphoning Shakespearean antiheroes.' -  *NY Times*
