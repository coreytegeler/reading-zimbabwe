Synopsis: This study examines the historical development and social, political and economic significance of gospel music in Zimbabwe. It approaches music with Christian theological ideas and popular appeal as a cultural phenomenon with manifold implications. Applying a history of religions approach to the study of a widespread religious phenomenon, the study seeks to link religious studies with popular culture. This study also seeks to bring to the fore the long-standing issue of the relationship between Christianity and African culture along with the neglected theme of music and the construction of religious and other identities.
