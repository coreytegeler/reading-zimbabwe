Synopsis: Christian Warfare in Rhodesia-Zimbabwe examines the history of the Salvation Army in Rhodesia-Zimbabwe and its relationships with the state and with the rest of the church. In particular, it examines parallels between events of the first Chimurenga, a rising against European occupation in 1896-97, and the second Chimurenga in the 1970s, the civil war that led to majority rule. At the time of the first, the Salvation Army was barely established in the country; by the second, it was part of the establishment. The book explores the enmeshment of this Christian mission in the institutions of white rule and the painful process of disentanglement necessary by the late twentieth century. Stories of martyrdom and colonial mythology are set in the carefully researched context of ecumenical relations and the Salvation Army's largely unknown and seldom accessible internal politics.

Review: *Christian Warfare in Rhodesia-Zimbabwe* tells a riveting and little-known story of Salvation Army operations in Africa. This is a no-holds-barred account of how William Booth's devotion to his London East End evangelical enterprise led him to be entangled in Cecil Rhodes's dubious scheme of colonization. . . . The book deserves a wide readership not just in Africa but in every country touched by Salvation Army operations. - Norman Etherington, Professor of History emeritus, University of Western Australia
