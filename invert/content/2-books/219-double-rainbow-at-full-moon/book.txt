Synopsis: Bodie and Clyde return to Zimbabwe in 2007, but the good times have departed. The country has the highest inflation in the world; people resort to suitcases and wheelbarrows, just to carry the money. Isolated from the rest of the world, they experience shortages of food, water and electricity, with endless line-ups for gas if any is available. The banking system is collapsing and only by trading on the black market are people able to feed themselves. To survive, Clyde's factory converts to producing ox-drawn carts. Governing party backed violence is worsening as a general election is called. Against all odds, many of the people come together across racial, religious and cultural lines. This is a story about how people react in times of extreme adversity. It is about survival, love, imagination and willpower. *Double Rainbow at Full Moon*  is also a wake-up call to the Western world about the consequences of economic mismanagement - a real human and economic thriller!

Review: Beautifully written - an important contribution to history and politics. A powerful saga, told with humour and compassion, capturing common life during troubled times, bringing out the best and the worst in people. - Margaret Spark
