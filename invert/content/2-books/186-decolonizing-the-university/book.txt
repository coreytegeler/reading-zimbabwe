Synopsis: This book is intended to contribute to discussions about the fundamental challenge of coloniality haunting humanities and social sciences in universities in Africa, while suggesting ways to de-link from and make a break with the epistemic injustices of embedded Eurocentrism that finds expression in the idea of and the content of academic disciplines as found in the current university system. It seeks to raise the possibility of a liberatory discourse on the intersection of power, epistemology, methodology and ideology in the hope that new epistemic lenses will be found and applied in order to achieve a better understanding of world realities, including realities on the periphery of the world system. It shows that the lenses embedded in the current coloniality of knowledge are in themselves technologies for suppression of horizontal discourses, subversive thought and new imagination. This book is the first to argue openly for epistemic disobedience against the imperialiality of social sciences and humanities conveyed through unthinking epistemology, methodologies, disciplines and research subjects.
