Synopsis: As sub-Saharan Africa continues to confront the runaway epidemic of HIV/AIDS, traditional healers have been tapped as collaborators in prevention and education efforts. The terms of this collaboration, however, are far from settled and continually contested. As *Modernizing Medicine in Zimbabwe* demonstrates, serious questions continue to linger in the medical community since the explosion of the disease nearly thirty years ago. Are healers obstacles to health development? Do their explanations for the disease disregard biomedical science? Can the worlds of traditional healing and modern medicine coexist and cooperate?

Review: *Modernizing Medicine in Zimbabwe* is an eye-opening book that details the historical roots of the cultural and political response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Zimbabwe. Simmons uses a variety of resources, including colonial records and missionary correspondence as well as interviews with traditional healers, to argue that the work of healers goes beyond malevolent forces, and that their vocation continues to be important in Zimbabwe despite efforts to restrict their therapeutic practices. - Janis Hutchinson
