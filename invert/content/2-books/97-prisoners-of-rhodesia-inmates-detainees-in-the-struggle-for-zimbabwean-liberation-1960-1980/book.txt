Synopsis: During the Zimbabwean struggle for independence, the settler regime imprisoned numerous activists and others it suspected of being aligned with the guerrillas. This book is the first to look closely at the histories and lived experiences of these political detainees and prisoners, showing how they challenged and negotiated their incarceration.

Review: *Prisoners of Rhodesia* is the first academic book-length study on the topical subject of political imprisonment in Zimbabwe. It is based on extensive and superb empirical historical research, combining archival and oral sources. The product is a ground-breaking academic contribution that extends frontiers of knowledge in Zimbabwean historiography in particular and African colonial political history in general.' - Professor Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gatsheni
