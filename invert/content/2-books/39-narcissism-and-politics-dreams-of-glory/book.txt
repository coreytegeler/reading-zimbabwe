Synopsis: In this age of narcissism, the proliferation of politicians with significant narcissistic personality features is dramatic. Driven by dreams of glory, they seem to find the spotlight that the arena of politics provides irresistible. This book analyzes narcissism and politics and systematically explores the psychology of narcissism - the entitlement, the grandiosity and arrogance overlying insecurity, the sensitivity to criticism, and the hunger for acclaim - illustrating different narcissistic personality features through a spectrum of international and national politicians. It addresses the power of charismatic leader-follower relationships, as well as the impact of age and illness on leaders driven by dreams of glory.

Review: Few scholars combine the clinical training, theoretical depth, and policy experience necessary to analyze the pervasive role of narcissism in political life. Jerrold Post does. If you read just one book on the subject, it should be his.  - Stanley Renshon, City University of New York
