Synopsis: Zimbabwe's July 2013 election brought the country's "inclusive" power-sharing interlude to an end and installed Mugabe and ZANU-PF for yet another—its seventh—term. Why? What explains the resilience of authoritarian rule in Zimbabwe? Tracing the country's elusive search for political stability across the decades, Michael Bratton offers a careful analysis of the failed power-sharing experiment, an account of its institutional origins, and an explanation of its demise. In the process, he explores key challenges of political transition: constitution making, elections, security-sector reform, and transitional justice.

----

Review: Compelling, thoroughly researched, and immensely informative.... Power Politics will also generate a great deal of discussion among Zimbabwe specialists as they confront the lessons and implications of Bratton's provocative analysis.— Perspectives on Politics
