Synopsis: *The History of Policing in Zimbabwe* is ‘priceless’ and apt in many ways. The book shows how policing is closely related with the politics of the day among other things.  This book is a must read. Why not? It is a book written by an expert who played a critical role in transforming the police force into a people’s organisation.

Review: Dr Chihuri on assuming leadership of the force was tasked with transforming it into a people’s force and in The History of Policing in Zimbabwe he lays bare what he inherited when he assumed leadership, his orders from his principals, from the masses and his obligation to those he leads.
