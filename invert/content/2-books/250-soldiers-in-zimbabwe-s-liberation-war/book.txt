Synopsis: This work is an attempt to look at some of the realities of Zimbabwe's liberation war and at what happened afterwards, rather than at the comfortable myths. Both heroic and terrible deeds are recorded.

----

Review: This work is an important landmark in the history of Zimbabwe's independence war and it will provide an important focus for not only military, social and economic historians, but also non-specialist readers with an interest in this fascinating conflict and its immediate aftermath. -  The Journal of Imperial & Commonwealth History
