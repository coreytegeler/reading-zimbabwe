Synopsis: This timely book deals with Zimbabwe’s independence, the elections crooked in ZANU-PF’s favour in 1980 and at every election since. South Africa’s destabilisation, genocide by Mugabe’s 5-Brigade in Matabeleland, Mugabe’s failed attempt to bring in his faulty constitution, the farm invasions, the murders and the mayhem in the lead-up to the 2000 elections. It is the up-to-date story of the destruction of a country by a president who is most likely clinically insane.
