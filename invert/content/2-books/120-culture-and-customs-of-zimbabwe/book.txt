Synopsis: Zimbabwe, formerly known as Rhodesia, won its independence from Great Britain in 1980 yet continues to feel the impact of Western lifestyles and prejudices. This rich, accessible overview freshly examines Zimbabwe, evoking the contemporary ways of life in a largely homogenous and agricultural country. Students and general readers will discover an engaging narrative that ranges from an explanation of the beer culture to a powerful discussion of marriage, family, and gender roles from the Zimbabwean perspective. Owomoyela also authoritatively conveys the coexistence of traditional and Western forces today in such areas as religion and music. A chronology and glossary accompany the text.

Review: Useful to students who want to put the works of Zimbabwean writers like Shimmer Chinodya, Tsitsi Dangaremba, and Chenjerai Hove into the proper social and cultural contexts. Owomoyela does an excellent job of showing how Zimbabwean writers use their characters to explore the frictions that arise when "tradition" simply cannot go on any longer. He is particularly adept at choosing examples that capture the tensions that stretch between genders and across generations. -*International Journal of African Historical Studies*
