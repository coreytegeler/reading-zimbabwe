Synopsis: Robert Mugabe was born in 1924, a black man in one of Africa's most defiantly white-dominated nations: Rhodesia. A revolutionary hero who came to prominence as a guerrilla leader in the 1970s, he has been a key player in Southern Africa ever since. For when Rhodesia became Zimbabwe in 1980, Mugabe became the public face of a hopeful experiment in African independence--but the next twenty-two years would tell a different story.

Review: . . . a finely argued text that explores one central question: Is Robert Mugabe an African hero fighting to reverse decades of colonial exploitation and the resulting inequality of land distribution? Or is he a modern day African Stalinist, ruthlessly amassing and retaining power with intimidation, savagery, and brutal repression? . . . [T]he fullest account to have been published to date. African Business, January 2003
