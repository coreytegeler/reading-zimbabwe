Synopsis: The advent and approach of colonization and Christianity condemned the African traditional religion and culture as paganistic and backward. This created issues of bi-culturalism and bi-religiousness in personal and religious identity that the church needs to address. For those living in most post-colonial countries, there is the existence of deep psychological and spiritual scars that need healing. The Western Christian rituals in use in most African mainline churches exclude any traditional religious rituals. A new pastoral theology of care and psychodynamic understanding of integrative consciousness is needed in these contexts. A pastoral caregiver with integrative consciousness (possessing an awareness of both the traditional and Western worldview and/or integration thereof) is required to address the psychological and religious identity conflict existing in postcolonial contexts such as Zimbabwe.

Review: Tapiwa N. Mucherera breaks new ground in narrating Shona religion and culture and specifying the impact of Christianity and Western culture on the indigenous methodology and cosmology. Because his work moves from the particular to the universal, it is easy for outsiders to see parallels with their own situation. His work on postcolonial literature is one of the best I have seen.  *Pastoral Care from a Third World Perspective *is without parallel.
