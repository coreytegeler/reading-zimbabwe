Synopsis: In *Hypermasculinity and State Violence in Zimbabwe Undermining Family Well-Being: An Africana Feminist Analysis of Maternal and Child Health*, Assata Zerai explores the demography of maternal and child health in Southern Africa from an Africana feminist sociological perspective. She presents a framework that considers the ways that nation, race, class, gender, sexuality, globalization, and other dimensions of oppression intersect to impact upon the experiences and agency of individuals and groups with health care and social support in Zimbabwe. She analyzes data sets from demographic and health surveys for the country. On the basis of the Africana feminist framework, Zerai argues that maternal and child health cannot be understood unless the socioeconomic, political, and cultural contexts are taken into account. She extends and tests the hypothesis that militarism (especially state violence) and hypermasculinity in Zimbabwe have deleterious effects on family well-being in general, and especially on maternal and child health. This work contributes importantly to the social scientific literature in the social demography of Africa because it adapts the vibrant intellectual work of Africana feminists to a quantitative methodology.

Review: Prof. Asata Zerai, an Africana feminist scholar, has written a landmark book based on Zimbabwe's demographic health data. Her book raises troubling connections between hypermasculinity, violence and poor infant and child health in Zimbabwe. She points out that Zimbabwe's relatively high literacy at just over 90% is necessary but not sufficient to avert stunting amongst children given that 33% of children are stunted in their development. This is a damning statistic and situation, pointing to the need to focus on providing clean water and better sanitation amongst the poorest in rural and urban Zimbabwe.
