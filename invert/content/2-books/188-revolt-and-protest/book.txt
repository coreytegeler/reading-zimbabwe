Synopsis: The evolution of student activism in sub-Saharan Africa is crucial to understanding the process of democratic struggle and change in Africa. Focusing on the recent period of ""democratic transitions"" in the 1990s, Leo Zeilig discusses the widespread involvement of student activism in democratic struggles across contemporary Africa and focuses on two case studies, Senegal and Zimbabwe. He provides an historical examination of the student-intelligentsia on the continent that played a crucial role in the independence struggles across much of Africa, leading and organizing nationalist movements and outlines the development of grass-root activism. Zeilig demonstrates how students shape and are shaped by national processes of political change and popular protest and reveals both the continuities and transformations in student activism in an era of austerity, crisis and poverty.

Review: The strength of the book lies in its empirical detail and analytical rigor. The author combines a deep knowledge of the historical and geographical contexts; extensive use of archival and local secondary sources; and over 100 interviews with former and current student activists, and with observers of student activism. These are woven into an engagingly written narrative that builds a vivid picture of the involvement of students in political change...the book addresses a fascinating topic of considerable contemporary relevance. It represents a major contribution to our knowledge of both the sociology of students and African politics. â€“ Nicola Ansell
