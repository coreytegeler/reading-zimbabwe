Synopsis: *Citizenship, Belonging, and Political Community in Africa* provides a critical reflection on citizenship in Africa by bringing together scholars working with very different case studies and with very different understandings of what is meant by citizenship. By bringing historians and social scientists into dialogue within the same volume, it argues that a revised reading of the past can offer powerful new perspectives on the present, in ways that might also indicate new paths for the future.

Review: The project collects the works of up-and-coming and established scholars from around the globe. Presenting case studies from such wide-ranging countries, the essays delve into the many facets of citizenship and agency as they have been expressed in the colonial and postcolonial eras.
