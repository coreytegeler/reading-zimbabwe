Synopsis: Patricia Chater wrote this account of her life from the unique position of an English woman who became absorbed into a religious community when she joined the caring and spiritual church of St Francis in Zimbabwe in the early 1960s. In a sympathetic, understated and matter-of-fact manner, she describes what it meant for the members of the community to struggle for liberation in their own land and then to face the challenges of the post-independence years. Her memoir is a contribution to the story of Zimbabwe, showing how national events impact on one particular place and on one particular group of people.
