Synopsis: 

This explosive, award-winning novella of growing up in colonial Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), told in exquisite, imaginative prose, touches the reader's nerve through the author's harrowing portrait of lives disrupted by white settlers, a young disillusioned black man, and individual suffering in the 1960s and 1970s. Marechera's raw, piercing writings secured his place in African literature as a stylistic innovator and rebel commentator of the ghetto condition.
While 'The House of Hunger' is the centerpiece of this collection, readers are also treated to a series of short sketches in which Marechera, with angry humor, further navigates themes of survival, madness, violence, and despair.
