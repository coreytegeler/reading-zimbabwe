Synopsis: Joining eighteen authors from six continents, *There is No Cholera in Zimbabwe* captures the silent struggles of the nameless, the oppressed, the marginalized, bringing you the stories the media neglects. Whether it be native tribes in Chile fighting for equal rights, sex slavery in Florida, violence against women in Zambia and Puerto Rico, environmental destruction in Iceland, political corruption in Mexico, or a dictator punishing his opposition by creating a cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe, these courageous journalists have placed a mirror up to the world to find the common thread of struggle against injustice that binds together the human spirit.
