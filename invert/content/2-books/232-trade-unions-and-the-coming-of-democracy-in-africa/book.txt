Synopsis: In a continent often associated with civil wars, malnutrition, and corruption, Trade Unions and the Coming of Democracy in Africa uniquely tells of the preeminent role that African trade unions played in ousting dictatorships and bringing democracy to many African countries in the 1990s and 2000s. It relates how democratic trade unions in South Africa, Ghana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Senegal, Niger, and Namibia were critical in launching democratic changes through persistent strikes and demonstrations. Working with other societal groups and political parties today, they continue to represent the popular classes and to invigorate democratic life in these otherwise elite-dominated countries in an era of neo-liberal capitalism and globalization. In this book, top scholars look at the efficacy of trade union and worker protest in overthrowing authoritarian governments in Africa. The analytical introduction and case studies from major African countries argue that unions were often the most important single social force in the democratization process.

Review: The strength of the book rests on the author's ability to comprehensively explore the historical, political and economic conditions for trade unions in various African democratic transitions...this carefully compiled and edited book is a "must-read" for all serious students of African politics and governance. - *New Agenda*
