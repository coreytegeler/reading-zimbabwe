Synopsis: 

----

Review: This elegantly written book amounts to far more than the memoir of a politician, lawyer and campaigner. In essence, David Coltart has composed an extended love letter to Zimbabwe, to the “people, hills, rivers, plains and trees” of a land that “becomes deeply embedded in one’s soul.” His own story is entwined with that of his country. David Blair, Daily Telegraph
