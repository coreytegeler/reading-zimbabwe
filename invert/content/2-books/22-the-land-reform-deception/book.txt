Synopsis: The Land Reform Deception looks at a particularly contentious period in Zimbabwe's recent history, from 2000-2008, when the government seized commercial farms using illegal and violent methods against an unarmed population of farmers and workers. Robert Mugabe's government began the seizures on a small, targeted scale in an effort to suppress opposition groups, but they soon escalated into an out-of-control frenzy targeting all farms in the country.

Review: 

Demonization diminishes informed criticism, and the case of the Zimbabwe land seizures is exactly one where the deep underlying animations, opportunisms and responses have been obscured by generalized condemnation. Charles Laurie provides a significant service by studying in considerable depth and detail key aspects of the land issue. His work is profoundly illuminating and allows us to build explanation and understanding of what happened in Zimbabwe, before moving on to critique and criticism.
