Synopsis: The news from Zimbabwe is usually unremittingly bleak. Perhaps no issue has aroused such ire as the land reforms in 2000, when 170,000 black farmers occupied 4,000 white farms. A decade later, with production returning to former levels, the land reform story is a contrast to the dominant media narratives of oppression and economic stagnation.

Review: Provides a panoramic assessment of the land question in Zimbabwe over the last century.... Although it is critical about various deficiencies of the fast-track land reform process and the subsequent agrarian reforms, it represents one of the few comprehensive renditions of the multifaceted progressive outcomes of these reforms. --Sam Moyo, African Institute for Agrarian Studies
