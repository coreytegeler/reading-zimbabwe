Synopsis: In *Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight*, Alexandra Fuller remembers her African childhood with visceral authenticity. Though it is a diary of an unruly life in an often inhospitable place, it is suffused with Fuller’s endearing ability to find laughter, even when there is little to celebrate. Fuller’s debut is unsentimental and unflinching but always captivating. In wry and sometimes hilarious prose, she stares down disaster and looks back with rage and love at the life of an extraordinary family in an extraordinary time.

Review: This is a joyously telling memoir that evokes Mary Karr’s *The Liars’ Club* as much as it does Isak Dinesen’s *Out of Africa*.—*New York Daily News*

Aboutauthor: Alexandra Fuller was born in England and grew up in Rhodesia/Zimbabwe, Malawi, and Zambia.
