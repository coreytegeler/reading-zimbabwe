Synopsis: This is a comprehensive textbook on Zimbabwean labour law. After detailing the history and purpose of the law, it offers a comprehensive review of contracts of employment, termination, the rights of organisation and association, and collective bargaining. Dispute settlement is discusses within the contexts of the right to strike, conciliation and arbitration, and the role of the courts in adjudication. State employment is treated separately, as it is governed by constitutional law as well as labour law. The book concludes with chapters covering aspects of social security in Zimbabwe, and a discussion on international labour law.
