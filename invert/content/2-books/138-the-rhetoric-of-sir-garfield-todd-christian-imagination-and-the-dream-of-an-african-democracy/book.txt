Synopsis: This work assembles the best of Todd's (available) speeches and provides an analysis of their rhetorical and political significance. Sir Garfield Todd's (1908-2002) lifelong support of African rights earned him initial political success, subsequent imprisonment, and, finally, rightful recognition. Often labeled a liberal in the British political tradition, a closer study of Todd's rhetoric demonstrates that his politics flow directly from his religious heritage―and not from political liberalism.

Review: Casey places in historical, political, and rhetorical context the high eloquence of this admirable man. He helps us see that Todd was an exemplary democrat, a true Christian who, in our own political climate of division and secrecy, can serve as a model of justice and dialogue for us all. Casey is to be commended for his careful research and scholarship and for his lucid and well-written interpretation of this important figure in the modern political history of Africa. ―Walter Jost, Associate Professor of English, University of Virginia
