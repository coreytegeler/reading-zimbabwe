Review: From Moscow to Canberra to Brazilia, educators around the world share a concern about the education of the most gifted of their youth. In this thoroughly researched and well-presented study of gifted education programs, Mitchell and Williams provide comparative information, in an organized and articulate manner, about programs and resources devoted to the schooling of the brightest and most talented. It is a timely and needed report. -Russ S. Hubbard
