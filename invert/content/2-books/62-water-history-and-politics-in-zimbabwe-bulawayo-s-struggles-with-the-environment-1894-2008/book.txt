Synopsis: This book examines the City of Bulawayo s struggles with the environment from 1894 to 2008 given its location in the perennially semi-arid region of south-western Zimbabwe. It focuses on a case-study of Makokoba, the city s first and oldest township, and explores the history of its African residents and their struggles over access to water during this period from a sustainable livelihoods perspective one which emphasizes that human security and environmental sustainability are inextricably intertwined. The book argues that water scarcity in Bulawayo, especially as it affected Africans for the most part, was a result of both biophysical conditions and man-made policies which were linked to deep-rooted struggles over access to, and management of, water resources in both colonial and postcolonial Zimbabwe.

Review: The first major study of the politics of water in Southern Africa, this path-breaking monograph will revolutionise the region’s historiography. Conceptually sophisticated and clearly written, *Water, History and Politics in Zimbabwe*, displays a mastery of the comparative secondary literature, even as it draws on a wealth of archival sources and oral interviews to develop interlinked local, regional and global themes. —Ian Phimister
