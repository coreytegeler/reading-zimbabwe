Synopsis: In *Imagining a Nation*, Ruramisai Charumbira analyzes competing narratives of the founding of Rhodesia/Zimbabwe constructed by political and cultural nationalists both black and white since occupation in 1890. The book uses a wide array of sources―including archives, oral histories, and a national monument―to explore the birth of the racialized national memories and parallel identities that were in vigorous contention as memory sought to present itself as history. In contrast with current global politics plagued by divisions of outsider and insider, patriot and traitor, Charumbira invites the reader into the liminal spaces of the region’s history and questions the centrality of the nation-state in understanding African or postcolonial history today.

Review: This remarkable book achieves the difficult goal of being both a rigorous piece of scholarship and a moving testimony about the experience of decolonization. From an analysis of the reconstruction of a national imaginary, it shows the ‘uses and abuses of history,’ while focusing on the art of strategic distortions and omissions, with the usual victims: the women and other expendable heroes. - Gérard Bouchard, Université du Québec à Chicoutimi
