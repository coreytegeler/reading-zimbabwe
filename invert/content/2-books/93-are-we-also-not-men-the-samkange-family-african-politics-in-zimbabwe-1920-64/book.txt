Synopsis: This collective biography of Thompson Samkange and two of his sons, Sketchley and Stanlake, illuminates much of the history of African politics in colonial Zimbabwe. But for the Samkanges, the road to politics lay through religion, so this is a history of African involvement in Methodism as well. Thompson Samkange was born in 1893 at the time his land was being overwhelmed by white settlers from the south. Stanlake Samkange, professor of history and writer of historical novels, lived to see the achievement of Zimbabwe's independence in 1980. Terence Ranger has conjured a book of creative originality out of a range of sources.
