Synopsis: This work shows how mission-educated Africans negotiated new identities for themselves and their communities within the confines of segregation. It examines strikes by students and parents, struggles over curricula, and efforts of African teachers to improve their professional status

Review: This is a worthwhile book, which fulfils an important historical need to revise the role of the early African intelligentsia. On the whole the author's case is convincing: elite educated middlemen were far from colonial puppets; they built African status; shaped policy debates; challenged white and black people alike; and laid foundations for the subsequent emergence of the mass nationalist parties. - John Louis Moore
